The subdirectories 'themes', 'private' and 'public' in this folder are the default directories that the file handler provided by core is allowed to access, public and themes is accessible to everyone, private is only accessible to logged in users with correct access rights.

You can change which directories are accessible to the file handler by editing the bootstrap.py file, though it is not recommended for inexperienced users.
