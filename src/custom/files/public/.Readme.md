Public Directory
===

Contents of this directory is accessible to anybody with the correct url, thus be mindful of what you place here!

Hidden files (filenames starting with a '.') are omitted and will not be sent out, unless the 'ALLOW_HIDDEN_FILES' option in 'bootstrap' is set to 'True'. This does NOT check for files hidden via the usual interface provided by the Windows platform, however preceding the filename with a '.' will still work on windows to prevent file access wia the url/handler.

It is recommended to delete this file before deploying this software with public access, since it does provide information to the management software used and generally makes you seem dumb since you should remove it!
