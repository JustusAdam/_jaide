Content Management System for web application.

The goal is to create a fast and easily expandable, modular CMS for every use imaginable. When finished and polished the core should be usable without any core modules to allow custom application as well as a good amount of common functionality in the core modules to make getting started quick and easy.

Currently there is no documentation and few comments and docstrings and it is by no means feature complete. Pull requests, contributions and feedback is very much welcome.
