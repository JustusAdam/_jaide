This directory is intended for *ALL* modules/packages that do not come pre-installed with this software.

Simply placing them in this folder, provided they have a correctly configured config.json (the name of this file depends on the settings in bootstrap.py) file in the package will suffice to have them being discovered and made available for use by 'core'.
